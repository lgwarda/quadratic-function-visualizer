# Quadratic Function Visualizer

## Overview

The Quadratic Function Visualizer is an interactive web application built using p5.js that allows users to explore and visualize quadratic functions. Users can manipulate the coefficients of the function and see how the graph changes in real-time. This tool is useful for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding quadratic equations better.

## Features

- Interactive sliders to adjust the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of the quadratic function.
- A movable point on the graph to see the function value at specific \( x \) coordinates.
- Dynamic visualization of the quadratic function as users modify the coefficients.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript is helpful but not required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

   ```bash
   git clone quadratic-function-visualizer


   cd quadratic-function-visualizer


   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the p5.js library and links to the sketch.
- `sketch.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the logic for the quadratic function visualizer.

## Usage

- Adjust the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) using the corresponding sliders to see how the graph changes.
- Move the point using the slider to see the value of the function at different \( x \) positions.

## Examples

- Set \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \) to visualize the standard parabola.
- Experiment with negative values for \( a \) to see inverted parabolas.
